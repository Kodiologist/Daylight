Presented by Tweedledum and Tweedledee \\
on 1 Nov 2009 \\
for the Org-Mode Association of America, \\
23rd Annual Meeting

* A simple slide

- Indirect realism

- Idealism
  - Berkeley
  - Schopenhauer

- G. E. Moore's "Proof of an External World"
  1. Here is one hand.
  2. And here is another.
  3. Therefore, at least two things exist. \\
    (Homework: fill in the details by proving that Moore's hands are distinct.)

Here is one paragraph.

And here is another.

* A busy slide

- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

- Pellentesque ac mi eget nunc sollicitudin porta ut in nunc.

- Integer et enim sit amet lorem accumsan posuere a eu.

- Sed nec tellus sed sem ultrices auctor sed et neque.

- Praesent pulvinar lectus sed tincidunt fermentum.

- Etiam pellentesque lectus ut lorem varius, et rhoncus mauris pretium.

- Duis nec urna vel risus lobortis aliquet vitae ut est.

- Sed condimentum odio vel aliquet scelerisque.

- Nunc ac tortor eget erat tempor ullamcorper.

- Praesent congue leo non lectus fringilla tempor.

- Vestibulum faucibus augue ac sodales congue.

* Experiment 1 method

From Smith and Trope (2006).

- Priming task: essay-writing
  - Low power-primed subjects (LPs) wrote about an experience "in which someone else had control over them".
  - High power-primed subjects (HPs) wrote about an experience "when they had control over another individual or individual".
  - Controls wrote about "their day yesterday".

- Categorization task
  - Rate how well an item (e.g., "car" or "camel") belongs to a category (e.g., "vehicle").

* Summary by experiment

1. HPs construed categories more abstractly.
2. HPs construed actions more abstractly.
3. HPs better detected hidden coherence.
4. HPs overgeneralized their memories more (*worse* performance).
5. HPs found more plausible (and more abstract) interpretations of pictures.
6. HPs found hidden details better (?).
7. HPs had more active right hemispheres (perhaps).

There was no consistent finding for controls compared to LPs and HPs.

* Math and a GIF

If we use the same model as the one assumed by the $t$-test, we get
 \[ Y ~ \Normal(b_0 + b_1X,\; σ) + \sum_{i = 1}^∞ n_i - \int_{0}^π F(x) dx\]
where $b_0$, $b_1$, and $σ$ (and $\sqrt{σ}$) are free parameters, and $X$ is $0$ for a blue room and $1$ for a red room. The CI we want is then the one for $b_1$.
